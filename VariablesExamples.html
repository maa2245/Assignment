		// I am a big fan of the New York Knicks and I have decided to use them as the topic for my assignment.
		// To make it easier for everyone I will use the abbreviation nyk. The Knicks are a professional basketball team and that's what I am going to use as the description for my string.
		
 		var nyk = "Professional basketball team";
 		console.log(nyk)
 		
 		// The New York Knicks were founded in 1946 and I am going to use nykAge for my variable and represent their age with a number.
 		
 		var nykAge = 68;
 		console.log(nykAge);
 		
 		// The Knicks have a long list of rivals, which I will list the biggest ones in an array that I've decided to name nykRivals.
 		
 		var nykRivals = ["Celtics", "Nets", "Lakers","Heat"]
 		
 		// The Knicks play at the prestigious Madison Square Garden in New York. 
 		
 		var nykMSG = {"location": "New York", "ticket price": "very expensive", "attendance": 18000}
 		console.log(nykMSG)
 		
 		//	In terms of success on the court, the Knicks have been lacking. But a recent report showed the team is worth 1.5 billion dollars.
 		// So if you asked whether the Knicks are a valuable franchise, the answer would be yes.
 		
 		var IsnykValuable = true;
 		console.log(IsnykValuable);
 		
 		
 		
 		// The Knicks have a star-studded lineup that I have called nykLineup and represented as an array. The players are represented in order of position on the court with Felton first as he plays the 1 position and Chandler last since he plays the 5.
 		// I have added a couple of facts about certain players as objects.
 		var nykLineup = ["Felton",{"age": 29}, "Prigioni",{"nationality":"argentinian"},"Shumpert",{"hair cut":"Will Smith during Season 1 of Fresh Prince"}, "Anthony", {"height": "6 feet 8 inches", "weight": "235lbs", "number": 7}, "Chandler"];
 		console.log(nykLineup);
 		
 		// The face of the Knicks is Carmelo Anthony so I am going to highlight him. In the array that I made above he is in sixth position so in order for my consol.log to show only him I have to write down the number 6.
 		
 		
 		console.log(nykLineup[6]);
 		
 		//I completely forgot that the Knicks were founded in the summer of 1946 meaning they are techincally 67 years old since it is still only February.
 		// I will correct my mistake by changing the value of nykAge and console.logging. It should now say 67.
